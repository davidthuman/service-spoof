# AI Assisted Coding

I am going to try out Claude Code and more generally AI-assisted features.

I have previously developed with GitHub's CoPilot (for a very short time), but I did not really dive in deep or really let the AI free. I also was not in the position, as a junior developers, to stunt my learning by allowing an AI to do a percentage of my coding.

Add contributions made my Claude Code will have the commit author with the same name (using the `--author "Claude Code<code@claude.ai>"` option on the `git commit` command).

## How I Will Act

I do want to remain in the development process, both to adjust any plans or code and so I can fully understand everything that is going on within the project. I do not want to "vibe-code".

## The Start

I already has a very simple Golang program that spoofed an Apache web-servers's 400 response page. I was able to log / dump the request.

I told Claude my overall goal for this project, it asked some questions, I answered, and then it went off. After the code generation and a couple compiler errors, it was able to build and run the program for some small testing.
